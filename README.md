## Indian Cities Analysis Project
This project is designed to identify the five closest cities to a user-input city in India and visualize these cities on a three-dimensional plot. It utilizes the geographical coordinates of the cities to calculate the Euclidean distances and determine proximity. This tool is useful for analyzing geographical distributions and proximities of cities in India, offering insights for urban planning, logistics, or travel planning.

## Installation
No additional installation is required except for standard Python libraries used in the script:pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.

## Usage
Run the script and input the name of an Indian city when prompted. The script will output the names and distances of the five closest cities to the input city and display them on a 3D plot.
